# NCacheDemo

This is the companion repo of my post [Working with ASP.NET Core IDistributedCache Provider for NCache](https://canro91.github.io/2022/04/11/DistributedCacheWithNCache/).

It contains two projects:

* [NCacheDemo.Tests](https://github.com/canro91/NCacheDemo/tree/main/NCacheDemo.Tests): It shows NCache basic caching operations
* [DistributedCacheWithNCache](https://github.com/canro91/NCacheDemo/tree/main/DistributedCacheWithNCache): It shows how to use ASP.NET Core IDistributedCache provider with NCache to speed up an API endpoint that makes a database call
